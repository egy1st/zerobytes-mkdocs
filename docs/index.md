# Welcome to ZeroBytes.One

If you are asking yourself, why this website called zero bytes, then let me tell you a secret "I just create zeros to give you the power to create complete bytes". In a nutshell, Zero Bytes is a journey from 0 ==> 1, from NULL to totally Full, from ***no***thing to ***some***thing, from **0**000 0000  ==>  0000 000**1**

# ZeroBytes: Why, How, and for Whom

`Why:` Obviously, there is a trade-off between gaining knowledge and the costly time and money to obtain these knowledge. I believe that knowledge should be available to learner in premium, but at no cost.

`How`: When Free means Premium. When less means More. This is the most complex formula I try to master in ZeroBytes. It is just a start, The more to come next.

`Whom`: My mission is to make the Arab world a better place to learn, gain knowledge and apply these knowledge to solve real-life problems that is result in leading a better life.

- **<u>DenMune Clustering Algorithm</u>**
  
    - **Description**: DenMune is a clustering algorithm that can find clusters of arbitrary size, shapes and densities in two-dimensions. Higher dimensions are first reduced to 2-D using the t-sne. The algorithm relies on a single parameter K (the number of nearest neighbors). The results show the superiority of the algorithm.
