# Welcome to ZeroBytes.One

If you are asking yourself, why this website called zero bytes, then let me tell you a secret "I just create zeros to give you the power to create complete bytes". In a nutshell, Zero Bytes is a journey from 0 ==> 1, from NULL to totally Full, from ***no***thing to ***some***thing, from **0**000 0000  ==>  0000 000**1**

# ZeroBytes: Who, How, and for Whom

`Who:` *Obviously, there is a trade-off between gaining knowledge and the costly time and money to obtain these knowledge. In ZeroBytes we believe that knowledge should be available to learner in premium, but at no cost.*

`How`: *When Free means Premium. When less means More. This is the most complex formula we master in ZeroBytes. We just started.. There are many things that seem impossible only so long as one does not attempt them.*

`Whom`: "Our mission is to make the Arab world a better place to learn, gain knowledge and apply these knowledge to solve real-life problems that is result in leading a better life.*

- **<u>DenMune Clustering Algorithm</u>**
  
    - **Description**: DenMune is a clustering algorithm that can find clusters of arbitrary size, shapes and densities in two-dimensions. Higher dimensions are first reduced to 2-D using the t-sne. The algorithm relies on a single parameter K (the number of nearest neighbors). The results show the superiority of the algorithm.
