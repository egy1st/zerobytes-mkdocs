# Welcome to ZeroBytes.One

If you are asking yourself, why this website called zero bytes, then let me tell you a secret "I just create zeros to give you the power to create complete bytes". In a nutshell, Zero Bytes is a journey from 0 ==> 1, from NULL to totally Full, from ***no***thing to ***some***thing, from **0**000 0000  ==>  0000 000**1**
