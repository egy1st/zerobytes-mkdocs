# What Python is

### Python is an interpreted programming language

This means you don't have to compile an entire program to see the results of your code as in many other languages like C++ which compiles all code and produces an executable file to run. On contraray yo that, Python executes statements individually (onr by one) and allows you check the results consequently. 

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.

Python is an object-oriented (based around data), high-level (easier for humans to understand) programming language. First launched in 1992, it’s built in a way that it’s relatively intuitive to write and understand. As such, it’s an ideal coding language for those who want rapid development. 

### Easy to Learn

Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.

### Rich Packges Repsitory

Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

### Why Python

If you’re wondering who uses Python, you’ll find that many of the biggest organisations in the world implement it in some form. NASA, Google, Netflix, Spotify, and countless more all use the language to help power their services. 

According to the TIOBE index, which measures the popularity of programming languages, Python is the third most popular programming language in the world, behind only Java and C. There are many reasons for the ubiquity of Python, including: 

Its ease of use. For those who are new to coding and programming, Python can be an excellent first step. It’s relatively easy to learn, making it a great way to start building your programming knowledge.
Its simple syntax. Python is relatively easy to read and understand, as its syntax is more like English. Its straightforward layout means that you can work out what each line of code is doing. 
Its thriving community. As it’s an open-source language, anyone can use Python to code. What’s more, there is a community that supports and develops the ecosystem, adding their own contributions and libraries. 
Its versatility. As we’ll explore in more detail, there are many uses for Python. Whether you’re interested in data visualisation, artificial intelligence or web development, you can find a use for the language. 

The most striking example is Python that took over the second position from Java.

Why is Python so popular? 
According to the TIOBE index, which measures the popularity of programming languages, Python is the third most popular programming language in the world, behind only Java and C. There are many reasons for the ubiquity of Python, including: 

Its ease of use. For those who are new to coding and programming, Python can be an excellent first step. It’s relatively easy to learn, making it a great way to start building your programming knowledge.
Its simple syntax. Python is relatively easy to read and understand, as its syntax is more like English. Its straightforward layout means that you can work out what each line of code is doing.

Why learn Python? 
So, we know why Python is so popular at the moment, but why should you learn how to use it? Aside from the ease of use and versatility mentioned above, there are several good reasons to learn Python: 

Python developers are in demand. Across a wide range of fields, there is a demand for those with Python skills. If you’re looking to start or change your career, it could be a vital skill to help you. 
It could lead to a well-paid career. Data suggests that the median annual salary for those with Python skills is around £65,000 in the UK. 
There will be many job opportunities. Given that Python can be used in many emerging technologies, such as AI, machine learning, and data analytics, it’s likely that it’s a future-proof skill. Learning Python now could benefit you across your career. 
How long does it take to learn Python?
As we’ve mentioned already, Python is a relatively straightforward programming language compared to many others. As such, it’s possible to learn the basics over just a few weeks. Many of our short courses, such as Getting Started with Python, take 6-8 weeks to complete, with only a few hours of learning required each week. 

### What is Python used for?
Clearly, Python is a popular and in-demand skill to learn. But what is python programming used for? We’ve already briefly touched on some of the areas it can be applied to, and we’ve expanded on these and more Python examples below. Python can be used for:  

1. AI and machine learning 
Because Python is such a stable, flexible, and simple programming language, it’s perfect for various machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) projects. In fact, Python is among the favourite languages among data scientists, and there are many Python machine learning and AI libraries and packages available. If you’re interested in this application of Python, our Deep Learning and Python Programming for AI with Microsoft Azure ExpertTrack can help you develop your skills in these areas. You can discover the uses of Python and deep learning while boosting your career in AI. 

2. Data analytics 
Much like AI and machine learning, data analytics is another rapidly developing field that utilises Python programming. At a time when we’re creating more data than ever before, there is a need for those who can collect, manipulate and organise the information. Python for data science and analytics makes sense. The language is easy-to-learn, flexible, and well-supported, meaning it’s relatively quick and easy to use for analysing data. When working with large amounts of information, it’s useful for manipulating data and carrying out repetitive tasks. You can learn about data analytics using Python with our ExpertTrack, which will help you develop practical data analytics skills. 

3. Data visualisation 
Data visualisation is another popular and developing area of interest. Again, it plays into many of the strengths of Python. As well as its flexibility and the fact it’s open-source, Python provides a variety of graphing libraries with all kinds of features. Whether you’re looking to create a simple graphical representation or a more interactive plot, you can find a library to match your needs. Examples include Pandas Visualization and Plotly. The possibilities are vast, allowing you to transform data into meaningful insights. If data visualisation with Python sounds appealing, check out our 12-week ExpertTrack on the subject. You’ll learn how to leverage Python libraries to interpret and analyse data sets. 

4. Programming applications 
You can program all kinds of applications using Python. The general-purpose language can be used to read and create file directories, create GUIs and APIs, and more. Whether it’s blockchain applications, audio and video apps, or machine learning applications, you can build them all with Python. 

5. Web development 
Python is a great choice for web development. This is largely due to the fact that there are many Python web development frameworks to choose from, such as Django, Pyramid, and Flask. These frameworks have been used to create sites and services such as Spotify, Reddit and Mozilla. Thanks to the extensive libraries and modules that come with Python frameworks, functions such as database access, content management, and data authorisation are all possible and easily accessible. Given its versatility, it’s hardly surprising that Python is so widely used in web development.
