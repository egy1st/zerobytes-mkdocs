after this few lines you will get full automated controling on your form without any additional code to write , it is incredible !


# **Convention**
-----
There are Two  Rules you must know about DC.DataManger

1. ` `Textbox Controls which located in your data form must have the same names as their Fields names in related table and Columns Controls which involved in your datagrid must have the same names as their Fields names in related table for details
1. Textbox Controls which located in your data form and not have related Field in related table must begin with "x" or "X" character , you can not name related Textbox Control with "X" or "x" prefix



 
# **System Requirements -----**
DC.DataManger runs as a COM class for Developing with Visual Basic.Net under Microsoft Windows 98/NT/ 2000 or Windows XP. 
# **Installing DC.DataManger-----**
The DC.DataManger setup program will automatically register the DC\_DataManger10.dll file on your system. 

There is no need to manually run RegSvr32.exe on your development system. 
# **Including DC.DataManger**
-----
To include DC.DataManger in your project 

1. From Project menu select add reference 
1. Push Browse button to locate your DC\_DataManger10.DLL file which by default located in [c:\windows\system32](file:///c:/windows/system32)  , now the specific DLL included in your references
1. Be sure that Micorsoft DataGrid Control Vresion 6.0 (OLEDB) is included in your Toolbox , if not then right click Toolbox 
1. From shortcut menu select customize Toolbox
1. From customize Toolbox Dialog ,scroll down and check Micorsoft DataGrid Control Version 6.0 (OLEDB)


# **Deploying DC.DataManger Applications -----**
The only file needs to be distributed with DC.DatManger COM applications is DC\_DataManger10.dll

this file should be copied to the WinSystem directory which by default is C:\Windows\System32 

**Note :** 

If you deploy a translated application with your local language , you must deploy DCDM10\_Lang.dll which located in your system directory which is by default [C:\Windows\System32\](file:///C:/Windows/System32/)  and place it in end user system directory
## **How to Create a DSN** 
-----
1- Open Windows’ ODBC Data Source Administrator as follows:
`    `In Windows 95, 98, or NT, choose Start > Settings > Control Panel, then double-click the ODBC Data     
`    `Sources icon. Depending on your system, the icon could also be called ODBC or 32bit ODBC.
`    `in Windows 2000, choose Start > Settings > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Data Sources.
`    `In Windows XP, choose Start > Control Panel > Performance and Maintenance > Administrative Tools >   
`    `Data Sources (ODBC).


2 - Click the System DSN tab.
`    `The tab displays the list of DSNs currently on your system. 

3- Click Add to add a new DSN to the list.
`    `The Create New Data Source dialog box appears, listing all the drivers currently loaded on your system. 

4- Select a driver from the list, then click Finish

**Example:**

If your database is a Microsoft Access file, select Microsoft Access Driver (\*.mdb). If a driver for your product does not appear in the list, you’ll have to download the driver from a vendor’s website and install it. 

In the dialog box that appears, enter a name for the DSN and specify the connection parameters.

The dialog boxes for specifying parameters differ depending on the driver you selected. For the Microsoft Access Driver, you enter a name, click Select, locate the database file on the hard disk, and click OK. 

Click OK to close the dialog box.

The new DSN is added to your list of system DSNs. 


# **InitForm**
# -----
Prepare form to know every thing about the form and its controls and all binding data . so it must be the first assignment in your code . an errors may occurs if you do not
# **syntax:**

dm\_DSN  is a reference to your DSN connection

dm\_Form is a reference to your form which passed as 'Me' keyword

dm\_MasterTable is a reference to your Master Recordset

Optional dm\_Grid (if your form has a grid) is a reference to your grid

Optional dm\_DetailTable (if your form has a grid) is a reference to your Details Recordset

**Example:**

Dim oMaster As New ADODB.Recordset()

Dim oDetails As New ADODB.Recordset()
